# 👋 Hello World. I'm Alex. 

**Technologist | Founder | Strategic Leader | Human**

I like to dream, design and build shit. Everything Digital. Physical Buildings. Teams. Businesses that make lots of money and Non-Profits that improve my community. 

Started in early 2000s LAMP stack dev, did cloud and cybersecurity before it was cool. Accidentally built an MSP that became a MSSP and rolled it into a national PE-backed platform. Now advise startups, preach on cybersecurity and business culture (yes, they can be synergistic. yes, I used synergistic). Exploring the future of AI and Innovation leadership.

This exists to help collaborators, founders, and future partners get a sense of how I work, my values, and how to best engage with me— professionally and personally.

## Situational Awareness

  **Origin** Grew up hand-coding PHP, HTML and SQL on dial-up in rural Idaho. The first HDD I installed was a Maxtor 10GB. I built my first website for my dad's company and it went live in Oct 18, 2000. I was 13yo.

  **First Company** Founded Exbabylon in Sept 2001 at 14yo. I built websites. Some people actually paid me.

  **Early Days** Built one of the world's first email filtering (anti-SPAM) platforms. We called it SpamSlayer and today you would say it was Cybersecurity SaaS. Back then it was a bunch of FreeBSD servers hand-built in a colo running Apache, Postgres and Exim running in a homemade cluster hacking SMTP/DNS to our will. Our competitor was Postini. We had the cooler name. They were bought by Google. We weren't. Went on to build the first (that I know of) hardened NESSUS Security Appliance with a web front-end. We called it SpookyBox. NSA gave us a TEMPEST certification. Lots of failures but more than my share of successes along the way.

  **Current Vibe** Pragmatic AI strategy, building on my long-standing HUMAN>TECH mantra, keeping human-in-the-loop by re-imagining how organizations operate in our new Agentic world. 

  **Global Citizen** Rooted in the mountains of the INW, live part-time in my wife's home country of Brazil and work/play across North America, LATAM and AMEA.

  **Passions** Family. Education. Running stupid distances. Summitting silly high mountains. Sailing and diving. Garden & Bees. Cooking.

  **Aspiration** Improve the lives of people along the HUMAN<>HUMAN chain, with everything I touch.

## Working With Me

  **Move Fast, Think Big** Entrepreneurial mindset required, no matter how established we are, every day should have a startup vibe. Think big but bring it back to actionable sprints. We don't just talk. We do.

  **Pivot Faster** No sacred cows. New information == new direction. I'll work tirelessly when we have deep conviction on an audacious idea but will pivot so fast it can feel like whiplash for those not used to it. Part of building is learning. If we need to blow it up to build something right we'll do it. Sunk cost/time/past decisions have no relevance.

  **Talk About It** I like to talk things through. Zoom out and bring everyone along in the vision. Getting shit done only happens after everyone knows the WHY and can articulate the macro strategy/vision. Highly complex ideas and big things require lots of alignment. Thinking through the long arc of idea>>operational production reality early allows for success at the end.

  **Short Meetings, Long Emails** Expect short meetings for tactical things. Turns out a lot can get done in 15min if everyone is engaged (but expect very long macro strategy sessions). I will send very large emails / whitepaper-style concepts from time to time and expect everyone to make time to digest. TLDR; is for those outside my team.

  **Blamestorming** We'll only talk about the past enough to repeat successes or not repeat failures. Identify root cause and fault only to learn, not criticise. The only thing that matters is what comes next. The most important day of our lives is today. You're on my team for a reason. You're smart and capable. If there's a problem we're going to talk about it in near real-time. I'll never ambush you with a list of long-past wrongs and expect the same in return. Otherwise, plan for success and move forward.

  **Disagree** A mentor once told me: "you're not doing your job unless you're regularly disagreeing with me". Discourse is foundational to high quality outcomes. Poke holes in things and look for risk upfront.

  **Work/Life Harmony** Balance is BS. Harmony is everything.

  **Building Humans** We're not just building whatever it is we're building. We're building ourselves and each other. This is not the last place you'll work and our collective job is to help each other grow and achieve our professional and person goals together. It's my responsibility to be an encouraging mentor that listens and helps you acheive your goals.
  
  **Family First** Always. Even if you're a family of one. We support the success of one another in work AND in life.

// "HUMAN > TECH" is my philosophy of a human first approach for any/everything I expect everyone to apply.

## Things to Know

  **My Communication Style**
    - My most productive time is in the AM where I read and consume and think.
    - I work 
    - I prefer chat to emails for internal comms but may reply in batches.
    - If you need something fast call me.

  **What I Assume About You**
    - You're great at what you do.
    - You're good but not perfect. You'll make mistakes (and I'll have your back).
    - You'll ask for help when you need it.
    - You love being wrong as much as you love being right.

  **What I Expect From You**
    - Honesty: mistakes happen. failure is not failure. anything but absolute candor gets in the way of everyone's success.
    - Proactive: don't wait for someone to ask, anticipate what others want, not just need, to know and share proactively. don't force others to drag things out of you.
    - Kindness: always. period.
    - Humility: assume you're in a room of people smarter than you. arrogance is weakness not strength.
    - Ask & Accept Help: my job is to get in the weeds and help. don't wait until you've exhausted resources to reach out. early and often.

## Quotes To Dream By

In 2001 at 14yo I founded a little company called Exbabylon to build websites for people. 

My excited-for-life kid slogan? "Imagine... a world without limitations"

That became >> "Imagination is the only limitation" in future iterations and was our company motto for over 20 years.

// Apparently I used 301 redirects when I launched the site in Oct 2001. So the earliest archive is April 2002:
// https://web.archive.org/web/20020526095821/http://www.exbabylon.com/

My lifetime dogma:

"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat." TEDDY ROOSEVELT, THE STRENUOUS LIFE, 10 April 1899

// *******And... Most Importantly... Never Give Up! Never Surrender!******* //

## How I Can Help / Give ##

  **Education** If you're working on something to advance education in the world, especially to young or underprivileged corners of our communities... I'm in.
  **Strategy** From startups to non-profits to government. I have an eclectic background that gives me a unique perspective when solving big problems.
  **Openness** I got my start because of BSD open source and an open web. Let's work on things that keep it that way.
